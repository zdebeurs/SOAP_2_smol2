Fit will require 1.2244284 GB of RAM for the final structure

MAXSTEPS set to 30000
NTHIN set to 200
These are the starting values for all fitted parameters
and the amoeba stepping scale, which is roughly the range
of parameter space it will explore around the starting value
and is equal to 3x any Gaussian width. When priors are not 
specified in 167.priors.6, a default guess is used.
The parameter number is useful for tracking down unconstrained
parameters

Using mkprior to refine your starting values and refitting
may result in a faster and more robust answer.
